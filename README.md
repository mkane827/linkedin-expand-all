# LinkedIn Expand All Extension
This is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to expand all of the comment threads and replies on a page. 

# Privacy
The Google Chrome Web Store requires a privacy policy for publishing extensions. This codebase represents the entirety of the extension. I load no additional code. There are no API requests made by this extension. Use of the extension will trigger LinkedIn.com to make requests to load content, but I do not access that. There are no analytics or tracking involved with this, so I have no way of accessing your data. Furthermore, I have no interest in your data, this is simply a tool to make your life easier. The extension is shipped with no minification or obfuscation so you can confirm that all of this is true in the Chrome Dev Tools.
